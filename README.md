## Developer Info
### Getting Started programatically
brachify uses the pythonocc library. Easiest setup is to use [Anaconda3](https://www.anaconda.com/download) as your python interpreter. Some modules take significant time to install using conda install. For those which seem to take time, try to use pip install instead (pip is included in conda)

- download code 
- Open Anaconda prompt with Administrator rights
- optional: create and activate a virtual environment
- install pythonocc using ```conda install -c conda-forge pythonocc-core```
- install the GUI library using ```pip install pyqt5-tools```
- install the dicom and other libraries using ```pip install pydicom``` etc.
- run main.py to use the application
