Modules should have short, all-lowercase names. Underscores can be used in the module name if it improves readability. 

Class names should normally use the CapWords convention.

Because exceptions should be classes, the class naming convention applies here. However, you should use the suffix “Error” on your exception names (if the exception actually is an error).

Function and variable names should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores as necessary to improve readability.
Always use self for the first argument to instance methods.
Use one leading underscore only for non-public methods and instance variables.
